## Notes  
  
- Dates and times must be entered in the format `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`.    
- Task numbers refer to the number shown in the `list` command.    
- Your tasks are automatically saved between sessions in the file path given at startup (default: `./data/amadeus.txt`).    
- Always type commands exactly as shown (case-insensitive for commands like `mark`, `unmark`, `todo`, etc.).    
- Modes Echo and D-mail are fun experimentation modes but you can always return to List mode to manage tasks.
